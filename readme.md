# CSharp Commands To Keep In The Brain!

The dotnet command has two functions:

1. It provides commands for working with .NET projects.

2. For example, dotnet build builds a project. Each command defines its own options and arguments. All commands support the --help option for printing out brief documentation about how to use the command.

3. It runs .NET applications.

4. You specify the path to an application .dll file to run the application. To run the application means to find and execute the entry point, which in the case of console apps is the Main method.
